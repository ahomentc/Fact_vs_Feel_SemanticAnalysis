# Fact_vs_Feel_SemanticAnalysis
A tool to tell if a bodies of text (Speeches transcripts, articles, etc.) use more Facts or Emotions. Gives the percentages of each.

In order to test:
1. Create a txt file and add whatever text you want
2. Inside, 'makePrediction.py', give a path in the if __name__ == '__main__' and run 'makePrediction.py'

Update:
Added webapp to use this online. Repository includes Django project. Can use that to run.
